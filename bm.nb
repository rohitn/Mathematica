(*  Geometric Brownian motion SDE  *)

(*//  dS_t = mu*S_t*dt + sigma*S_t*d*W_t  //*)
(* where W_t is a Wiener Process/Brownian Motion *)

(* Analytic solution  *)

(* Wiener Process/Brownian Motion *)
(* 
   1. W_0 = 0
   2. W has independent increments: for every t > 0, W_(t+u) - W_t, u>=0, are independent of the past values W_s, s <= t
   3. W has gaussian inrements: W_(t+u) - W_t ~ N(0, u)
   4. W has continuos paths: W_t continuous in t
