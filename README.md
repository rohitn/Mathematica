### Stochastic Processes

  - A sequence of random variables
  
### Brownian motion heuristics

  - Observe Dust Particles
  - Indirectly confims atoms exist
  - Gas particles must be effecting dust particles
  - Many collisions between dust and invisible gas means we can treat the movement of dust as random

  - Mathematically, we model the position of such a particle in space as time evolves using a stochastic process
    - A natural assumption to make about such a process is that between timesteps, the particle move continuously, and does not move that much.
    - Continutous evolution: Calculus.
    - Random Distribution with a mean: Probability.
    - How do we marry them to create predictions?

### Ito's Integral
  
  - 

### Wiener-Process

   - Virtually a Synonym for Brownian Motion

### Geometric Brownian Motion

  - Mirrors A Wiener Process, with the difference that we add a term so that it is an increasing function
